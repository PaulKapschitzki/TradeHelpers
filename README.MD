This will be a desktop electron app to create some Helper Tools for my trading like Pre-Trade-Checklists, Positions Size Calculator etc.

## Open To-Do's for later
- Values of 1R, 2R, 3R on Share Size Calculator shouldn't go below 0.00
- Entry, Stop Loss and Target values should always be displayed with 2 decimals
